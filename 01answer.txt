A database is a structured collection of data that allows for easy access, management, and updating.
Example: In an e-commerce application, a database stores customer information, product details, orders, and transactions. Without a database, it would be difficult to handle and query this data efficiently.

We need a database beacuse:
To organize data systematically.
To allow multiple users to access data simultaneously.
To ensure data consistency, security, and easy retrieval.
