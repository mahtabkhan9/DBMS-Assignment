A file-based storage system involves storing data in separate files on a computer.

Challenges:
Data Redundancy: Repeated data across multiple files.
Data Inconsistency: Changes in one file may not reflect in others.
Lack of Security: Files lack sophisticated access controls.
Limited Querying Capability: No efficient way to search or retrieve specific data.
Concurrency Issues: Multiple users accessing the same file can cause conflicts.
