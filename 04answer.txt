Five Challenges of File-Based Systems Tackled by DBMS:
1. Data Redundancy: DBMS reduces duplication by storing data centrally.
2. Data Inconsistency: Centralized updates ensure consistency.
3. Data Security: Access is restricted based on user roles.
4. Concurrency Control: Multiple users can safely access data simultaneously.
5. Efficient Querying: Complex data searches are simplified with query languages like SQL.
