Three-Schema Architecture in DBMS and its Advantages:

Levels:
External Schema: User-specific views of data.
Conceptual Schema: Centralized representation of the entire database.
Internal Schema: Physical storage of data.

Advantages:
Data Abstraction: Users are insulated from underlying complexities.
Data Independence: Changes in one schema donâ€™t affect others.
Efficiency: Ensures optimal data access and management.
